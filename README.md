# Overview

This repository contains various different example docker-compose files that show how to setup the WarpStream Agents in docker-compose. Each example has its own docker-compose.yaml file and README.

File an issue or join [our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/warpstreamlab-uwt2030/shared_invite/zt-20nj8a1v7-HVTTV_MCWsCH7pLuMuObvw) if you run into any issues or want to ask us a question.

# Examples

1. Use the `demo-example` if you want to run the WarpStream Agent in `demo` mode where it will create an ephemeral cluster and generate synthetic data into a test topic.
2. Use the `playground-example` if you want to run the WarpStream Agent in `playground` mode where it will create an ephemeral cluster, but not generate any synthetic data.
